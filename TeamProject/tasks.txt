Here is the task left to do:
- final format of menu and getMenu API
- deisgn google sheet database in a way it can store more than 1 pizza per order with just 1 orderID
(my suggestion is store different pizza on consecutive lines, but don't increase the orderID, dunno it it can be done)
- implement post according to database design (should be dynamic)
- design the status - time based (playing with timestamp) or state based (need someone to input the states)
- query out status based on orderID
- query out status by just asking check status (amazon echo generates the same customerID every time, we can leverage this)
- get customer name/phone for extra features (optional)
